                            <h3>Neymar Jr</h3>
                            <p class="player-deails">Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior was born in Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo, to Neymar Santos Sr. and Nadine da Silva. He inherited his name from his father, who is a former footballer and became his son's advisor as Neymar's talents began to grow.Neymar comments on his father's role: "My father has been by my side since I was little. He takes care of things, my finances and my family." Growing up, Neymar combined his love of futsal with street football. Neymar said that futsal had a massive influence on him growing up, helping him develop his technique, speed of thought and ability to perform moves in tight spaces.

                                In 2003, Neymar moved with his family to São Vicente, where he began playing for youth side Portuguesa Santista.Then, later in 2003, they moved to Santos, where Neymar joined Santos FC.[20] With the success of his youth career and added income, the family bought their first property, a house next to Vila Belmiro, Santos' home stadium. Their quality of family life improved, as at age 15, Neymar was earning 10,000 reais per month and at 16, 125,000 reais per month. At 17, he signed his first full professional contract, was upgraded to the Santos first team, and began signing his first sponsorship deals. A lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of "The Machine of '87", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games. However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, at age 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. As his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, Newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise.[22] He was scouted by Buenos Aires club River Plate, whose playmaker, Pablo Aimar, he idolised, but they were also unable to pay for his treatment due to Argentina's economic collapse. His goalscoring idol growing up was Ronaldo, with Messi calling him "the best forward I've ever seen".</p>

                            <h3>Lionel Messi</h3>
                            <p class="player-deails">Messi was born on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, Santa Fe, the third of four children of Jorge Messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the northcentral Adriatic Marche region of Italy and Catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, "Leo" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers.[15] At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches.[16] He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute to his grandmother.A lifelong supporter of Newell's Old Boys, Messi joined the Rosario club when he was six years old. During the six years he played for Newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of "The Machine of '87", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games.[20][21] However, his future as a professional player was threatened when, at age 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency.

                            <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo</h3>
                            <p class="player-deails">Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in São Pedro, Funchal, on the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in Santo António, Funchal.[9][10] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time kit man.[11] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde.[12] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia".[13] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure.[14] Ronaldo grew up in a Catholic and impoverished home, sharing a room with all his siblings.[15]

                                As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[16] where his father was the kit man,[11] and later spent two years with Nacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.[17] He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete, near Lisbon, to join Sporting youth football academy.[17] By age 14, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally, and agreed with his mother to cease his education in order to focus entirely on football.[18] While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him.[18] However, one year later, he was diagnosed with a racing heart, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[19] Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate.[20] He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[21]</p>

                            <p class="player-deails">Dybala was born in Laguna Larga, Córdoba, Argentina.[6] His grandfather, Bolesław Dybała, was from the village of Kraśniów in Poland; he fled from his country of birth to Argentina during World War II.[7][8] Some of his grandfather's family moved to Canada.[9] Dybala's family also has partial Italian origins through his maternal great-grandmother, whose surname was Da Messa, from the Province of Naples.[7][10][11][12]

                                Dybala obtained Italian citizenship on 13 August 2012,[13] in order to facilitate his move to Palermo F.C.[14] and circumvent FIGC regulations that permit only a maximum of two non-EU players in any Serie A team.[15] Dybala initially attempted to obtain Polish citizenship through ancestry from his grandfather, but the bureaucracy proved too complex.[14]
                                
                                Dybala is the youngest of three brothers and lost his father in 2008 to cancer.</p>

                            <h3>Mesut Ozil</h3>
                            <p class="player-deails">Mesut Özil (German pronunciation: [ˈmeːzut ˈøːzil], Turkish: [meˈsut œˈzil]; born 15 October 1988) is a German professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder for Süper Lig club Fenerbahçe. Nicknamed "The Assist King",[2][3][4][5][6][7] Özil is known for his technical skills, creativity, agility, and finesse.[8] He has also played as a wide midfielder in his career.

                                Born and raised in Gelsenkirchen, Özil began his senior club career playing for hometown club Schalke 04, before signing with Werder Bremen in 2008, aged 19. After winning the DFB-Pokal in his first season, his individual performances led to a move to Real Madrid in 2010.[9] There, he helped the club win a La Liga title, and ranked first in league assists for three straight seasons.[10] In 2013, Özil was the subject of a then-club record association football transfer when he signed for Arsenal in a transfer worth up to £42.5 million (€50 million), becoming the most expensive German player ever at the time. In England, he won three FA Cups and helped end Arsenal's nine-year trophy drought, while recording the second most assists ever (19) in a Premier League season. In 2021, Özil joined Fenerbahçe on a free transfer.[11]
                                
                                A German international, Özil holds the record for the most German Player of the Year awards (5). He made his senior debut for the Germany national team in 2009 at age 20, and appeared in five major tournaments. He was the top assist provider at the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012, where he helped Germany twice reach the semi-final. Özil helped Germany win the 2014 FIFA World Cup, but retired from international competition in 2018, alleging discrimination and disrespect by the German Football Association (DFB) and the German media.</p>

                            <p class="player-deails">Mauro Emanuel Icardi (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈmawɾo emaˈnwel iˈkaɾði]; born 19 February 1993) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a striker for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Argentina national team.

                                Icardi began his footballing career at La Masia, the youth system of La Liga club Barcelona, before moving to Serie A club Sampdoria to begin his professional career in 2012; after an impressive season, he joined Inter Milan in July 2013,[3] where he developed into one of the most prolific strikers in Europe. Icardi won the Capocannoniere in both the 2014–15 and 2017–18 seasons,[a] and was named the captain of Inter in 2015, at age 22.[4] Three years later, Icardi was integral for Inter reaching a place in the UEFA Champions League, their first time in six years,[5] as he became the club's eighth-highest goalscorer of all time.[6] In 2019, Icardi signed for Paris Saint-Germain on an initial one-year loan deal,[7] where he won a domestic treble. He then joined the club permanently in a €50 million deal.
                                
                                Icardi made his senior debut for Argentina in October 2013 but since has played sparingly. Icardi was controversially left out of Argentina's final squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[8]
                                
                                Icardi has been a subject of controversy due to his marriage to Wanda Nara, whose ex-husband is Icardi's former Sampdoria teammate Maxi López. López and Nara divorced because of her exposed relationship with Icardi.[9]</p>

                                Mbappé began his senior career with Ligue 1 club Monaco, making his professional debut in 2015, aged 16. With them, he won a Ligue 1 title, Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year, and the Golden Boy award. In 2017, he signed for league rivals Paris Saint-Germain on an initial loan, which was made permanent in 2018 in a transfer worth €180 million plus add ons, making him both the second-most expensive player and most expensive teenager.[4] There, Mbappé won three Ligue 1 titles, three Coupe de France titles, was named Ligue 1 Player of the Year twice, and has finished as Ligue 1 top scorer for three consecutive seasons.

                            <h3>Mohamed Salah</h3>
                            <p class="player-deails">Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly (Arabic: محمد صلاح حامد محروس غالى‎, Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: [mæˈħam.mæd sˤɑˈlɑːħ ˈɣæːli]; born 15 June 1992) is an Egyptian professional footballer who plays as a forward for Premier League club Liverpool and captains the Egypt national team. Considered one of the best players in the world,[6][7] he is known for his finishing, dribbling, and speed.

                                Salah started his senior career with Egyptian club Al Mokawloon, departing shortly thereafter to join Swiss side Basel for an undisclosed fee. In Switzerland, his performances attracted Premier League side Chelsea, who signed him in 2014 for a reported fee of £11 million. However, he was used sparingly in his debut season and was allowed to leave on loan to Serie A clubs Fiorentina and Roma, with the latter eventually signing him permanently for €15 million. Following his role in helping Roma to a second-placed finish and a club record points-tally in 2017, Salah returned to the Premier League to sign for Liverpool for a then club-record fee of £36.9 million.
                                
                                In his second spell in England, Salah adapted his game from a natural winger to a forward, and he netted 32 goals in 36 league games in his debut season, winning the Premier League Golden Boot and breaking the Premier League scoring record for a 38-game season. Salah's performances earned him a number of individual accolades, including the PFA Players' Player of the Year. He also came third in the 2018 Best FIFA Men's Player award. The following season, he finished as the Premier League's joint-top goalscorer and helped Liverpool win the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League, scoring in the final. In his third season at the club, he helped the team win the 2019–20 Premier League, which ended the club's 30-year league title drought.
                                
                                At international level, Salah represented Egypt at youth level before making his senior debut in 2011. Following his performances at the 2012 Summer Olympics, he was named CAF Most Promising African Talent of the Year. Since then, he has helped Egypt reach the final of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, and was top scorer during CAF qualification to help the team qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Salah has been named the CAF African Footballer of the Year (2017 and 2018), BBC African Footballer of the Year (2017 and 2018), and was selected in the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations Team of the Tournament and the CAF Team of the Year on several occasions.</p>

                                Born and raised in the London borough of Waltham Forest, Kane began his career at Tottenham Hotspur, where, after fast progression through the team's youth academy, he was promoted to the senior team in 2009, at age 16. He did not initially feature for the side, and was loaned out several times to clubs across the English football pyramid, including Leyton Orient, Millwall, Leicester City, and Norwich City. Kane's involvement at Tottenham began to increase following the arrival of Mauricio Pochettino as head coach in 2014. In his first full season at the club, Kane scored 31 goals across all competitions, was the Premier League's second-highest goalscorer, and was named PFA Young Player of the Year.
                                
                                In the 2015–16 and 2016–17 seasons, Kane finished as the league's top goalscorer. In the latter campaign, he helped Tottenham finish as the competition's runners-up and won the PFA Fans' Player of the Year award. Kane registered his best campaign statistically to date in the 2017–18 season, with 41 goals scored in 48 games across all competitions, and in the following season, he finished as a runner-up in the UEFA Champions League. In February 2021, he became Tottenham's second-highest all-time goalscorer in official competitions. He ended the 2020–21 season as the top goalscorer and top assist provider in the league.
                                
                                Kane has scored 38 goals in 60 games for England. He appeared and scored at every youth level, and made a goalscoring debut with the senior team in March 2015, aged 21. Kane featured and scored during England's successful UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying, and represented the country at the tournament itself. He was made the squad's captain from May 2018, before the 2018 FIFA World Cup. In that tournament Kane finished as the World Cup's top goalscorer, winning the Golden Boot, leading England to fourth place, their highest finish since 1990.[6] He also led England to second place at the 2020 UEFA European Championship, marking their first appearance in a final at the tournament and their first major final since 1966.[7]</p>

                            <h3>Kevin De Bruyne</h3>
                            <p class="player-deails">Kevin De Bruyne (born 28 June 1991) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Manchester City, where he is vice-captain, and the Belgium national team. He is one of just three players (the others being Cristiano Ronaldo and Thierry Henry) to have won the PFA Players' Player of the Year award back to back, and the only midfielder and Belgium player to have done so in English football history.[5]

                                De Bruyne began his career at Genk, where he was a regular player when they won the 2010–11 Belgian Pro League. In 2012, he joined English club Chelsea, where he was used sparingly and then loaned to Werder Bremen. He signed with Wolfsburg for £18 million in 2014, where he established himself as one of the best players in the Bundesliga and was integral in the club's 2014–15 DFB-Pokal win. In the summer of 2015, De Bruyne joined Manchester City for a club record £54 million. He has since won three Premier League titles, five League Cups and an FA Cup with the club. In 2017–18, he had a significant role in Manchester City's record in becoming the only Premier League team to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2019–20, De Bruyne tied the record for most assists in a Premier League season and was awarded Player of the Season.
                                
                                De Bruyne made his full international debut in 2010, and he has since earned over 80 caps and scored 22 goals for Belgium. He was a member of the Belgian squads that reached the quarter-finals both at the 2014 FIFA World Cup and at UEFA Euro 2016. He represented Belgium at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where Belgium won the third place play-off match against England, and was named in the FIFA World Cup Dream Team.
                                
                                De Bruyne has been named in the UEFA Champions League Squad of the Season four times, the IFFHS Men's World Team, the UEFA Team of the Year and the ESM Team of the Year three times each, the France Football World XI, and the Bundesliga Team of the Year. He has also won the Premier League Playmaker of the Season twice, Manchester City's Player of the Season three times, the PFA Players' Player of the Year twice, the UEFA Champions League Midfielder of the Season, the Bundesliga Player of the Year, the Footballer of the Year (Germany), the Belgian Sportsman of the Year and the IFFHS World's Best Playmaker.</p>

                            <h3>Philippe Coutinho</h3>
                            <p class="player-deails">Philippe Coutinho Correia (born 12 June 1992) is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as an attacking midfielder or winger for Spanish club Barcelona and the Brazil national team. He is known for his combination of vision, passing, dribbling and ability to conjure curving long-range strikes.[4]

                                Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Coutinho showed prodigious talent and excelled in Vasco da Gama's youth system. He was signed by Italian club Inter Milan in 2008 for €4 million and subsequently loaned back to Vasco, where he became a key player. He made his debut for Inter Milan in 2010, and was later loaned to La Liga club Espanyol in 2012. In January 2013, Coutinho joined English club Liverpool for £8.5 million. He flourished at Liverpool, being named in the PFA Team of the Year in 2015.[5][6] In January 2018, Coutinho signed for Barcelona for a club record fee reportedly worth €160 million (making him the world's second most expensive player at the time),[7] and won two La Liga titles. However, he was loaned to German club Bayern Munich on a season-long loan ahead of the 2019–20 season, being a part of the team that won a treble including the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and UEFA Champions League.[8]
                                
                                Coutinho made his senior international debut in 2010. He was part of the Brazilian squad at the 2015 Copa América, the Copa América Centenario in 2016, and made his World Cup debut at the 2018 FIFA World Cup where he scored two goals and was named to the FIFA World Cup Dream Team; he was also a member of the Brazilian team that won the 2019 Copa América on home soil.
